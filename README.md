#Heat Solver with Direct and Iterative Methods, using simulating a low Reynolds flow over a heat source
## Options for FVM/FDM, Direct/Indirect, Jacobi/Gauss Seidel, Sparse/Dense Matrix
## Ability to change velocity, thermal conductivity, heat transfer coefficient

Only run main.py for CHT solver

stokes.py can also be run individually
